\subsection{Conclusion}
We have presented a thorough empirical study showing the effectiveness
of ISHA compared to a wide variety of baselines for the
stochastic bandit model, along with an information-theoretic lower bound.
The main missing piece is a proof of our upper bound in Conjecture~\ref{conjecture:main}.
Further work might analyze ISHA for the non-stochastic setting.
It is also interesting to consider other bandit algorithms which make
the same bold approach of sampling as many arms as possible and beginning
to reject them with very little data for, e.g., the contextual bandit
setting.
